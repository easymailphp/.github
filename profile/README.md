# EasymailPHP

Hey there, we're EasymailPHP, a library dedicated to making the world of PHP emails easy and simple again.

## How can I download the library?

Our library is currently in a private alpha testing stage while we enhance our library, patch bugs, and fix security vulnerabilities.

## When will the library be released?

Unfortunately, at this point in time, we are still unable to determine when our library will become public. Please check this page often for status updates about our public beta in the near future.

Meanwhile, you may be interested in checking out the built-in PHP functions, such as the PHP IMAP and PHP MAIL functions.

## Any questions?

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to start a [discussion thread](https://github.com/orgs/easymailphp/discussions).
